### Project Overview:
Link: https://github.com/android/codelab-android-dagger

* User Registration
- main.MainActivity will navigate the non-registered user to EnterDetailsFragment. then onCreateView will set up liveData observer and collect user's data
- After Adding Credentials, Next Button press will Trigger EnterDetailsViewModel's validate fn
- On validation success, fields will be stored, and as the property is a
- observed live data, if it changes, it will trigger the observe callback declared
- inside onCreateView of this (EnterDetailsFragment) class, which will again trigger
- RegistrationViewModel's updateUserData fn and trigger
- the RegistrationActivity's onDetailsEntered fn, from there, will call
- TermsAndCondition Fragment, if accepted, will call again the RegistrationActivity's
- onTermsAndConditionsAccepted() fn, which will call registrationViewModel.registerUser(),
- and finally it will call UserManager's register fn, from there the SharedPreference Store
- will be populated, and will instantiate UserDataRepository with current UserManager Object

### Include Dagger to a Project:
```kotlin
// app level build.gradle

plugins {
//    id 'com.android.application'
//    id 'kotlin-android'
//    id 'kotlin-android-extensions'
//    id 'kotlin-kapt'
}

// ...

dependencies {
    // ...
    // def dagger_version = "2.40"
    // implementation "com.google.dagger:dagger:$dagger_version"
    // kapt "com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:$dagger_version"
}
```
### Dagger @Component:
An interface annotated with `@Component` will make Dagger generate code with all the dependencies required to satisfy the parameters of the methods it exposes. Dagger will create a Container like as manual dependency injection. @Component Interface is the entry point.

* All Dagger Interfaces are usually put inside a separate package/directory named `di`
### @Module, @Binds and @BindsInstance annotations:
`@Module` : use this to tell Dagger what implementation of an `Interface` we want to use. This will be passed as @Component param. Modules are a way to encapsulate how to provide objects in a semantic way by grouping similar task

@Provides : 
 
`@Bind` : Inside @Module interface, @Binds is used to tell Dagger which implementation it needs to use when providing an interface.

`@BindsInstance` : it tells Dagger that it needs to add that instance in the graph, for objects that are constructed outside of the graph (e.g. instances of Context). This is used inside `@Component` and `@Component.Factory` inside of it. 

```kotlin
@Component(modules = [StorageModule::class])
interface AppComponent {

    /**
     * it's a factory for a/this component
     * A factory is a type with a single method that returns a new component
     * instance each time it is called. The parameters of that method allow the caller to
     * provide the modules, dependencies and bound instances required by the component
     */
    @Component.Factory
    interface Factory {
        /**
         * There must be exactly one abstract method,
         * which must return the component type or one of its supertypes
         * kt's function without body inside interface is abstract fn
         * from Application, Context will be passed using
         * DaggerAppComponent.factory().create(applicationContext)
        */
        fun create(@BindsInstance context: Context): AppComponent
    }

    /**
     * We're telling Dagger that
     * RegistrationActivity will requests (field) injection and that it has to
     * provide the dependencies which are annotated with @Inject
     */
    fun inject(activity: RegistrationActivity)
}



/**
 * @Module is used to instruct Dagger what implementation of
 * an `Interface` we want to use. This will be passed as @Component param.
 * Modules are a way to encapsulate how to provide
 * objects in a semantic way by grouping similar task
 */
@Module
interface StorageModule {
    /**
     * @Binds instruct Dagger of which implementation it needs to use when providing an interface.
     * the return type should be that interface and implementations are defined inside parameter's type
     */
    @Binds
    fun provideStorage(storage: SharedPreferencesStorage) : Storage
}
```

### Creating DaggerAppComponent Graph & Requesting Injection From Activity:
Application class is a good place where the DaggerAppComponent Graph can be created. Also Context can be passed easily from there.
```kotlin
open class MyApplication : Application() {

    val appComponent: AppComponent by lazy {
        DaggerAppComponent.factory().create(applicationContext)
    }
}
```
From Activity with `@Inject` annotated field, Request needs to be made to do the actual injection. Needs to be done before super.onCreate in onCreate.
```kotlin
class RegistrationActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject
    lateinit var registrationViewModel: RegistrationViewModel

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {

        /**
         * Ask/Request Dagger Graph to Inject the dependency
         * Perform this before calling super.onCreate inside Activity to avoid issues with fragment restoration
         * during the restore phase, Activity will attach fragments that might want to access activity bindings.
         */
        (application as MyApplication).appComponent.inject(this)

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_registration)

        // ...
    }
    
    // Other Code
}
```


From `Fragment` Request for injection needs to be made on onAttach(context: Context) override.
```kotlin
    @Inject
    lateinit var registrationViewModel: RegistrationViewModel

    @Inject
    lateinit var enterDetailsViewModel: EnterDetailsViewModel

override fun onAttach(context: Context) {
    super.onAttach(context)
    (requireActivity().application as MyApplication).appComponent.inject(this)
}
```
### Scopes :
When 2 or more types share a same dependency, we need to tell dagger to provide a same instance for all of them. Otherwise, then requesting multiple times, dagger will provide different instances. Here the `scope` comes into play
 
By Scopes in Dagger means "to scope a type to the Component's lifecycle". Scoping a type to a Component means that the same instance of that type will be used every time the type needs to be provided/injected.

If we annotate a Component with @Singleton, any other dependency class also annotated with @Singleton will be scoped to its lifetime.

```kotlin
// AppComponent Dagger Component
@Singleton
@Component(modules = [StorageModule::class])
interface AppComponent { ... }

// Injected Class, as annotated with @singleton, the dagger will inject same instance for every class that request it through the @Component
@Singleton
class UserManager @Inject constructor(private val storage: Storage) {
    ...
}
```
### SubComponent and Scope:
"`SubComponents` are components that inherit and extend the object graph of a parent component. Thus, all objects provided in the parent component will be provided in the subcomponent too. In this way, an object from a subcomponent can depend on an object provided by the parent component."

* SubComponents are typically placed inside it's lifecycle matcher's directory/packages.

To make a SubComponent and request for injection -
1. Define a SubComponent `interface` with `@Subcomponent` Annotation. Note: Components may not be annotated with more than one component annotation (like @Subcomponent and @Module in same interface/class will throw error), for this we need to create `@Module` component separately and add that the SubComponent in @Module 's list.
```kotlin
// Define the SubComponent Interface
@Subcomponent
interface RegistrationComponent {
    @Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): RegistrationComponent
    }

    // Classes that can be injected by this Component
    fun inject(activity: RegistrationActivity)
    fun inject(fragment: EnterDetailsFragment)
    fun inject(fragment: TermsAndConditionsFragment)
}

// Add the SubComponent in Separate Class for adding it as Module
@Module(subcomponents = [RegistrationComponent::class])
class AppSubcomponent {
}
```
2. From parent Component define a fun that returns that SubComponent.Factory
3. Add SubComponent module class in parent Component's module list.
4. Then request for injection using SubComponent class's function via parent component's function `(application as MyApplication).appComponent.registrationComponent().create().inject(ThisActivity)`
5. Also create a prop in Activity from the SubComponent Type and request for injection from the activity's Fragment using `(activity as ParentActivity).parentActivityProp.inject(thisFragment)`

### SubComponent Scoping:
Note: Like as Component, Within SubComponent, When 2 or more types share a same dependency, we need to tell dagger to provide a same instance for all of them. Otherwise, then requesting multiple times, dagger will provide different instances. Here the `scope` comes into play

With SubComponent Scoping, we can separate an instance lifecycle (that Dagger injects) from Parent Component's lifecycle (which is typically match with application lifecycle). 

* Note, we cannot use Same Scope annotation with Parent Component and SubComponent. As javax only provide @Singleton annotation, we need to define our own annotation and use with the SubComponent
```kotlin
// Define Custom Scoping Annotation. Usually place this class in `di` package/directory
@Scope
@MustBeDocumented
@Retention(value = AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class ActivityScope()

// Then Use the annotation with SubComponent interface and the class that need to have the same lifecycle as the SubComponent
@ActivityScope
@Subcomponent
interface RegistrationComponent {
    @Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): RegistrationComponent
    }
    // ...
}

// the class that need to be same shared inject across the SubComponent
@ActivityScope
class RegistrationViewModel @Inject constructor (val userManager: UserManager) {}

```
### Multiple Activity With Same Scope

### Graph (SubComponent's Factory) as Dependency:
We can instantiate the graph using Class Parameter and access the Factory Create to handle its instantiation inside of that class. And the graph will be destroyed if nothing is pointing to it. 
```kotlin
// parent AppComponent
@Singleton
@Component(modules = [StorageModule::class, AppSubcomponent::class])
interface AppComponent {
    //...
    fun userManager(): UserManager
}

// AppSubComponent
@Module(subcomponents = [RegistrationComponent::class, LoginComponent::class, UserComponent::class])
interface AppSubcomponent {}

// UserComponent
@LoggedUserScope
@Subcomponent
interface UserComponent {

    @Subcomponent.Factory
    interface Factory {
        fun create(): UserComponent
    }

    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
    fun inject(activity: SettingsActivity)
}


// Class that is scoped with the UserComponent
@LoggedUserScope
class UserDataRepository @Inject constructor (private val userManager: UserManager) {/*...*/}

// Instantiation of SubComponent Graph
@Singleton
class UserManager @Inject constructor (private val storage: Storage,
    private val userComponentFactory: UserComponent.Factory) {
// ...
var userComponent: UserComponent? = null
        private set

fun logout() {
    userComponent = null
}

private fun userJustLoggedIn(){
    userComponent = userComponentFactory.create()
}


// requesting fro injection from different activity
// MainActivity
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    @Inject lateinit var mainViewModel: MainViewModel

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val userManager = (application as MyApplication).appComponent.userManager()

        // ...
        
        userManager.userComponent!!.inject(this)

    }
}

// SettingsActivity
class SettingsActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    @Inject lateinit var settingsViewModel: SettingsViewModel

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        val userManager = (application as MyApplication).appComponent.userManager()
        userManager.userComponent!!.inject(this)
    
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    // ...
}
```
