### General Keyboard Helpers:
- `ctrl + p` inside fn will suggest all the params
- `ctrl + space` will suggest
- `ctrl + o` override/implement fn suggestion in side class
- typing `this.` + `ctrl + space` inside a lambda block (scope) will suggest more precisely
- `alt + enter` to import
- `alt + enter` inside a typo (word with curly underling) will fix
- `r` will refresh xml layout design
- `ctrl + q` to preview function/code signature

### Add Keyboard Custom Shortcuts:
`Ctrl + Comma` - to toggle running device
### Android Studio Custom Configuration
1. `Allow Logcat Automatically` allow this form Bottom `Run` tab's setting -> miscellaneous to see what's happening and fast check runtime errors.
### Compose
- typing `wc` in editor for column template
- Tooling : https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling#editor-actions
### Intellij Plugins:
`Key Promoter x` suggest short-cut of possible task done through GUI in IDE 
### Gradle Plugins:
`kotlin-parcelize` gradle plugin provides a Parcelable implementation generator automatically. docs https://developer.android.com/kotlin/parcelize

first add the gradle plugin `kotlin-parcelize` then use like
```kotlin
import kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize

@Parcelize
class User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable
```

### Digging Tricks:
1. Ctrl + click function and inspect usages in current project. There are options for include/exclude Test classes, preview sources, etc. 

### Jump Start Unknown/Other's Project:
Visual Debugging: 
=> Use layout Inspector with live emulator's update
=> Analyze the app inside emulator and layout inspector at the same time

Debugging From Scratch:
=> Find the main activity (entry point) in manifest.xml
=> From entry Point, find the attached modules or view files
=> Find if there is a Navigation Graph

### Notes on adding Dependencies:
* First add the root/project level `build.gradle` requirements and build/sync. Then add all other module level gradle requirements.

### Importing Helper Not Working:
1. write the full function name and call (ie, functionName()), then check if there is any help from the IDE
2. add or inspect if the correct dependency is there in build.gradle
3. manually add import like `library.package.name.*` the try again

### Changing Project Name:
=> From Studio's project tab as `Android`, refactor all occurrence by selecting `com.something.<packagename>` to new name. 
=> Also change app level build.gradle's `applicationID` and `namespace` with valid format (no dash `-`, use underscore `_`)
=> Also change settings.gradle's rootprojectname. 
=> find the package (`java package`) in each kotlin/java file inside `src/main` and test directories.

### Easy Debug:
Add Associated Class (tools:context) in root layout element per file => `tools:context="com.domain.project.package.className"`

### Some Common Errors:
* non-Gradle Java modules + Android-Gradle modules in one project:
    - `Invalidate Cache and Restart` => after restart => close the project => then delete `.gradle` and `.idea` directory from the root of the project => open Android Studio and Open the selected project.

* Kotlin and compileDebugJavaWithJavac' version mismatch => Make all the version use same JDK
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kt :app level
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}
```

### Working With xml Layout file:
- `r` for refresh the xml design layout
- placeholder text `tools:text` and image `tools:src`
- split code and xml side by side (not horizontally): right click the tab and select `split right`.
- layout rendering issue: change `api version for preview` also try to make android studio full screen mode
### androidTestImplementation vs testImplementation vs implementation vs androidTestCompileOnly:


### Open Multiple Projects:
To open multiple projects simultaneously in Android Studio, go to `Settings` > `Appearance & Behavior` > `System Settings`
in the Project Opening section, choose `Open project in new window` & save.
* After this, while on a project, `file` > `open` and select will open the project in new window without closing the previous one.
