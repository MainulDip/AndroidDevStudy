## Birds Eye view (Overviw):
Building Android/Spring (Java/Kotlin) Apps from scratch should have some standardized workflow to build it quickly, more systemically, also maintain and running Tests. Here are some personalized workflow docs and why cases.


### Why Interface and Abstract Classes? How those help:
 If the values of properties and implementations of functions are not known, make the class abstract. For example, Vegetables have many properties common to all vegetables, but you can't create an instance of a non-specific vegetable, because you don't know, for example, its shape or color. So Vegetable is an abstract class that leaves it up to the subclasses to determine specific details about each vegetable.

Interfaces don’t have a constructor, one class can inherit multiple interfaces. Where only one abstract class can be inherited.

Abstract classes can’t be final because the main reason they exist is for other classes to extend them. However, their methods and properties can be final. In fact, they’re final by default.

### When to use an abstract class (For closely related classes, abstract Animal is closely related to Dog/Cat class):
- An abstract class is a good choice if we are using the inheritance concept since it provides a common base class implementation to derived classes.

- An abstract class is also good if we want to declare non-public members. In an interface, all methods must be public.

- If we want to add new methods in the future, then an abstract class is a better choice. Because if we add new methods to an interface, then all of the classes that already implemented that interface will have to be changed to implement the new methods.

- If we want to create multiple versions of our component, create an abstract class. Abstract classes provide a simple and easy way to version our components. By updating the base class, all inheriting classes are automatically updated with the change. Interfaces, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. If a new version of an interface is required, we must create a whole new interface.

- Abstract classes have the advantage of allowing better forward compatibility. Once clients use an interface, we cannot change it; if they use an abstract class, we can still add behavior without breaking the existing code.

- If we want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of our component, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow us to partially implement our class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.


### When to use an interface (common functionality for unrelated classes):
- If the functionality we are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface. Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing a common functionality to unrelated classes

- Interfaces are a good choice when we think that the API will not change for a while.

- Interfaces are also good when we want to have something similar to multiple inheritances since we can implement multiple interfaces.

- If we are designing small, concise bits of functionality, use interfaces. If we are designing large functional units, use an abstract class.

### Map For Kotlin Interface, Abstract Class and JUnit Testing With Spring Boot:
Task: make the full map of the kotlin springboot repository (That is inside of the KotlinEveryday Spring Repository)


### Elvis Operator | (?:) :
_price.value = (quantity.value ?: 0) * PRICE_PER_CUPCAKE
The elvis operator (?:) means that if the expression on the left is not null, then use it. Otherwise if the expression on the left is null, then use the expression to the right of the elvis operator (which is "0" in this case)

### Functional Interface || Lambda Interface || SAM:
It's like Java's Single Abstract Method Class. With kotlin's syntactic sugar, we can implement the abstract method just like a lambda fn.
```kotlin
/**
* Here the 3rd param is required to implement a functional interface or SAM named TabLayoutMediator.TabConfigurationStrategy
* the interface has only one abstract method `onConfigureTab(TabLayout.Tab tab, int position)` which we need to implement.
* using a lambda we can implement this
*/
TabLayoutMediator(tabLayout, viewPager) { tab, position ->
    tab.setIcon(getTabIcon(position))
    tab.text = getTabTitle(position)
}.attach()
```
