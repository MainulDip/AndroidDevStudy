### Compose Frequently Used Functions:
- `rememberCoroutineScope` -> it creates a coroutine scope bound to the composable. that scope can be used anywhere to launch coroutines `scope.launch {}`. The scope will be destroyed when the composable that called it is removed from tree.

- `rememberAsState`

- `LazyListState` -> A state object that can be hoisted to control and observe scrolling. In most cases, this will be created via rememberLazyListState. It's kind of a eventListener on scrolling event of the composable that call/initialize (using `rememberLazyListState()`) it.
```kotlin
// initializing LazyListState
val lazyListState = rememberLazyListState() // returns a LazyListState

// will return true/false when the composable will start and stop scrolling
Log.d("rememberLazyListState", "lazyListState.isScrollInProgress => ${lazyListState.isScrollInProgress}").

// Most of the time this is used to capture LazyList Position
// can be used to store scrolling position on Shared Preferences and 
// restore that exact position (list items top index) when will app launch next time
```

- `rememberLazyListState` -> Creates a LazyListState that is remembered across compositions (re-compositions). 

### @Composable vs @UIComposable, @ComposableTarget, ect:
There can be exception scenario, but usually
- @Composable only -> Custom Composable
- @Composable + @UIComposable + other -> Composables coming from Libs

### Compose use Uni-Directional/One-Way Data Flow vs Bi-Directional 2 way data binding:


### inline, noinline, crossinline:
- `inline` Fn: will include the lambda into call site (without creating a Function Object) when compiled. Lambdas inside inline fn are allowed for `non-local return (return will be the return of enclosed/calling fn)`. But the inline fn can not access private members/methods of the enclosing class unless those members/methods are declared `internal` and annotated with @PublishedApi.

- inline fn with `noinline` param lambda: the lambda will not be inlined and cannot `return` to the calling function. 

- inline fn with `crossinline`: the lambda will be inlined in compiled call site but cannot return as non-local.
