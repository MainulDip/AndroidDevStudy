## Overview:
This is part two of the continued android-app-fundamentals. It's the compiled form of https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/unit-2 and some more.

### Some UI-Elements/Views:
- EditText - for entering and editing text

- TextView - to display text like the service question and tip 
amount
- RadioButton - a selectable radio button for each tip option

- RadioGroup - to group the radio button options, android:checkedButton="@id/option_twenty_percent" checked initially/default

- Switch - an on/off toggle for choosing whether to round up the 
tip or not

The UI for an Android app is built as a containment hierarchy of components (widgets), and the on-screen layouts of those components (Buttons, TextViews, ImageViews). Note those layouts are UI components themselves.


### Terms:
- androidx : Jetpack based UI-Component Library
- xmlns : XML namespace
- @+id/.... : a new resource ID

### Get User Input:

### View binding and findViewById:
Quick access to a view element using findViewById. like
```kotlin
val Button myButton = findViewById(R.id.my_button); // tied with the xlm view elemnt "android:id="@+id/my_button"
```

View Binding makes it much easier and faster to call methods on the views in your UI. You'll need to enable view binding for your app in Gradle, and make some code changes.

Enable View Binding:  app's build.gradle
```gradle
buildFeatures {
    viewBinding = true
}
```

MainActivity.kt
```kt
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)

        // Old way with findViewById()
        val myButton: Button = findViewById(R.id.my_button)
        myButton.text = "A button"

        // Better way with view binding
        val myButton: Button = binding.myButton
        myButton.text = "A button"

        // Best way with view binding and no extra variable
        binding.myButton.text = "A button"
    }
}
```

Note: The name of the binding class is generated by converting the name of the XML file to Pascal case and adding the word "Binding" to the end. Similarly, the reference for each view is generated by removing underscores and converting the view name to camel case. For example, in Pascal case activity_main.xml becomes ActivityMainBinding, and can be accessed using @id/text_view as binding.textView.


### Currency Formatter and XML's String Parameters:
* Currency Formatter: NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format($amount)
* String Parameters: On app > res > values > strings.xml
```xml
<string name="tip_amount">Tip Amount: %s</string>
```
On activity
```kotlin
// set the tipResult
binding.tipResult.text = getString(R.string.tip_amount, formattedTip)
```

* Development Placeholder Text Attribute: tools:text="Tip Amount: $7"

* ViewModel, Observable Data Objects and LiveData,
