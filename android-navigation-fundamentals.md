## Overview:
This Docs is aming towards the app's navigation workflow of the android framework.

### Intent:
An intent is an object representing some action to be performed. Like lanuching an activity. Intent describes the request, not the actual result.

* explicit intent: it is highly specific, where you know the exact activity to be launched, often a screen in your own app

* implicit intent: it is a bit more abstract, where you tell the system the type of action, such as opening a link, composing an email, or making a phone call, and the system is responsible for figuring out how to fulfill the request. You commonly use implicit intents for performing actions involving other apps and rely on the system to determine the end result. You'll use both types of intents in the Words app.

### Setting Up Explicit Intent Steps:
1: get the context
2: create intent passing the context and the destination activity.
3: Inject data to the intent with putExtra
4: Call the startActivity() method on the context object, passing in the intent object.
