## Overview:
This Docs is aming towards the app's navigation workflow of the android framework.

### Intent:
An intent is an object representing some action to be performed. Like lanuching an activity. Intent describes the request, not the actual result.

* explicit intent: it is highly specific, where you know the exact activity to be launched, often a screen in your own app

* implicit intent: it is a bit more abstract, where you tell the system the type of action, such as opening a link, composing an email, or making a phone call, and the system is responsible for figuring out how to fulfill the request. You commonly use implicit intents for performing actions involving other apps and rely on the system to determine the end result. You'll use both types of intents in the Words app.

### Setting Up Explicit Intent Steps:
1: get the context
2: create intent passing the context and the destination activity. On Recycler view, 
3: Inject data to the intent with putExtra
4: Call the startActivity() method on the context object, passing in the intent object.
5: Get data to the targated 


### Setting Implicit Intent:
* types: Action_VIEW (Open in browser), CATEGORY_APP_MAPS (Launhes Maps), CATEGORY_APP_EMAIL (launching the email app), CATEGORY_APP_GALLERY (launching the gallery (photos), ACTION_SET_ALARM, ACTION_DIAL (phone call)
* Commont Types: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common

* Steps:
    - Define intent like val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, query_url)
    - Fire context.startActivity(intent)

### Menu:
* Add Menu Resource File: by new > android resource file. The Resource type should be menu and file name can be layout_menu. A new directory should be created in res with layout_menu.xml file. And define menu item as
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <item android:id="@+id/action_switch_layout"
        android:title="@string/action_switch_layout"
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_linear_layout"
        app:showAsAction="always"
        android:iconTint="@color/white"/>
</menu>
```
* also reference the icons for the menu.

* onCreateOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected:
 - onCreateOptionsMenu : override this function and inflate the menu xmml file with menuInflater to actually draw the menu inside app bar when first created. The android system will provede the icon positioning. Icon can also be set by initial state here.
  - onOptionsItemSelected: this override is required to add the functionality when the menu button is tapped/clicked.

```kotlin
    /**
     * this will actually draw the menu icon on the app bar
     */
    override fun onCreateOptionsMenu(menu: Menu?): Boolean {
        menuInflater.inflate(R.menu.layout_menu, menu)
        return true
    }

    /**
     * this will be called upon menu item interaction by menu/item's id or itemId
     */
    override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem): Boolean {
        return when (item.itemId) {
            // check if the tapped menu item is same as targeted menu item
            R.id.action_switch_layout -> {
                isLinearLayoutManager = !isLinearLayoutManager
                chooseLayout()
                return true
            }
            // otherwise do nothing by returning default option by ide/system
            else -> super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)
        }
    }
```
